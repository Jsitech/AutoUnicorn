# AutoUnicorn

Automated Powershell Attack Creator Using Unicorn By TrustedSec

Unicorn

Magic Unicorn is a simple tool for using a PowerShell downgrade attack and inject shellcode straight into memory.
Based on Matthew Graeber's powershell attacks and the powershell bypass technique presented by David Kennedy (TrustedSec)
and Josh Kelly at Defcon 18.

AutoUnicorn Automates the Process of creating a PowerShell Attack with Unicorn, compiling the Payload into an
executable file and launching the listerner to receive the incoming connection.

It can be used for fast payload creations in Pentesting Tasks.
